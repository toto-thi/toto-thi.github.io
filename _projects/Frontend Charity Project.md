# The TJ Charity Web Application

It is a charity platform for Lao's people via crypto currency. I chose to use Ethereum Network and ETH test network to build this project. Within Web Application, User can request a donation project or campaign by filling out data and expected donation amount. (User must connect to MetaMask before making a request).

## Connect to MetaMask

MetaMask will be integrated into this project mainly to connect the wallet and handle transaction through contract address of each project and between wallets.
